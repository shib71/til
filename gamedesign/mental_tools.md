# Mental Tools

This is a list of processes and exercises useful for designing games.

## Theme / Audience Synopsis

The theme and intended audience are as much a part of the game as the rules
and components. Articulate and adjust them as part of the rest of the rest
of the design. This can also include things like "this game is fast paced"
or "strategic playing has a big effect on the games outcome" - just as rule
changes can cascade, so too can changes in theme and feel.
